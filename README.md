# kodexx-rotation30

Simple program in Python that uses the Spotify API via the Spotipy library to create a shuffled playlist of 30 tracks, from a user's playlist, without repeating the same artist.

To use it, you will be prompted to specify the playlist you want to copy the tracks, and the new one you want to put them, so that the kodexx-rotation30 can bring 30 shuffled songs to that new playlist, without artist or band repetition.

Note that this code assumes you have already created a Spotify developer account and obtained your client ID and secret. 
To do so, be sure to update the client_id, client_secret and username specs directly on the code.
Also, the redirect_uri should be defined (ex. your localhost)

This is a work in progress (v.a01).
New implementations will come.
