# kodexx-rotation30

Simple code in Python that uses the Spotify API via the Spotipy library to create a shuffled playlist of at least 30 tracks, without repeating the same artist within the previous 30 songs.

To use it, you need to specify the playlist you want to copy the tracks, and the new one you want to put them, so that the kodexx-rotation30 can bring 30 shuffled songs to that new playlist, without artist or band repetition.

Note that this code assumes you have already created a Spotify developer account and obtained your client ID and secret. 
Be sure to update the playlist_name and new_playlist_name variables to match your own playlist names.
Also, the redirect_URI should be defined (ex. your localhost)

This is just a work in progress.
New implementations witl come.
